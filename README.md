# Pomodoro-Timer-App

The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique aims to enhance focus and productivity by providing structured work and rest periods.

Features:

1. Timer functionality: The timer consists of work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks. The default configuration is 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute short break. After completing four work intervals, a longer break of 20 minutes is provided.

2. Countdown mechanism: The timer displays the current phase, such as "Work," "Short Break," or "Long Break," and counts down the remaining time in minutes and seconds.

3. Progress tracking: A checkmark system is included to track completed work intervals. Each work session is represented by a checkmark, and the checkmarks accumulate on the screen as the user progresses through their tasks.

4. Reset and start: The timer can be reset to its initial state using the "Reset" button. To start the timer, simply click the "Start" button.

5. User interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) features a clean and intuitive design with a tomato image representing the work interval. The interface provides a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

To use the Pomodoro Timer, run the script and interact with the buttons on the interface. Start the timer to begin your work intervals, and take advantage of the breaks to rest and recharge. Use the reset button to start a new session or make adjustments to the timer settings.

Boost your productivity and manage your time effectively with the Pomodoro Timer!

Note: The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s and has since gained popularity as a valuable time management tool.
